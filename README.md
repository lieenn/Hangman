# Hangman

Welcome to Hangman! The object tive of this game is to guess the hidden word letter by letter before running out of lives.

Rules:
- Guess letters one at a time. If a guessed letter is in the word, it gets revealed; otherwise, you lose a life.
- You start with a set number of lives. Each incorrect guess reduces your remaining lives.
- If you guess all letters correctly before running out of lives, you win.
- If you run out of lives before guessing the word, you lose.
- The game provides visual feedback on the remaining lives using ASCII art for a hangman figure.
- If you guess a letter you've already guessed, it won't count and won't affect your remaining lives.

Enjoy playing Hangman!
